May 21, 2014

Epicodus: Week10, Day1

First day working with APIs.

********************
Lesson

Build an app that lets users send text messages to their friends.

*  As a user, I want to send a text message to a phone number, so that I can send texts from the web.

*  As a user, I want to save contacts to an address book, so that it's easy to text them again without re-typing their phone number. DONE

####################
ISSUE: dropdown menu in new message form breaks integration test b/c receiving contact now chosen directly rather than to number being entered directly
####################

*  As a user, I want to send a message to more than one person at once, so that I can mass text my friends. DONE

####################
ISSUE: ajax after new message created is now faulty b/c of functionality to send to multiple contacts
